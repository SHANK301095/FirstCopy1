- This is a scaffolded baseline with placeholder UI/routes and data models; full feature implementation will be layered incrementally.
- Prisma client generation and migrations are deferred until database credentials are provided.
- Auth flows and secure upload integrations are stubbed pending environment setup.
# Assumptions

- Auth is stubbed with a demo admin session until a real auth provider is wired.
- Cart/checkout flows are UI placeholders pending full transactional endpoints.
